# fastcore-rs

Rust re-implementation of `navis` and `nat` core functions with a
focus on efficient algorithms for working with
[rooted trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)#Rooted_tree),
a special case of directed acyclic graphs (DAG) used to represent neurons.

We provide [R](./R/nat.fastcore/) and [Python](./py) bindings.

## Usage

See the README for the [navis](./py) and [nat](./R/nat.fastcore/) wrappers for instructions on installation and usage.
